# Horiseon homepage refactoring

In this challenge I have refactored the existing HTML and CSS files in order to improve the accesibility and semantic structure of the Horiseon homepage.

## Actions taken

In this challenge I focused on:  
    - adding alt descriptions to images 
    - removing duplicate CSS 
    - replacing div tags with correct tags e.g. aside, footer, section
    - adding anchor links 
    - added comments to html and css files 
    - adding meta description in head tag
